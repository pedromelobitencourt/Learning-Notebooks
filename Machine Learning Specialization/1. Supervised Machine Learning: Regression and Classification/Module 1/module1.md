# Overview of Machine Learning

Machine Learning had grown up as a subfield of AI, in order to build intelligent machines

Machine learn to do things by itself

* AGI (Artificial General Intelligence): machines as intelligent as normal people


# Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning

* **Machine Learning**: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuel

In general, the more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform

The two major types of machine learning algorithms are:
* **Supervised learning**: it's the most used one in real-world applications and it has rapid advancements

* **Unsupervised learning**

* **Recommender systems**

* **Reinforcement learning**

## Supervised Machine Learning

You give your learning algorithm examples to learn from and they include the right answers (the correct label (output) for the current input)

Input to Output mappings

By seeing the correct pairs of input and desired output, the learning algorithm learns how to take the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the input

* **Regression**: predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers

* **Classification**: predict a small number of categories (few possible outputs and not necessarily numbers)

    * Class (category): the output

## Unsupervised Learning

It's given data that isn't associated with any output labels

Data only comes with inputs, but not outputs to learn from. For this reason, the algorithm needs to find a structure in the data

It has to find patterns or something interesting in unlabeled data

It's called **unsupervised** because we're not trying to quote some right answer for every input

* **Clustering**: it places the unlabeled data into different clusters, based on similar information

* **Anomaly Detection**: find unusual data points

* **Dimensionality Reduction**: compress data (usually from a big dataset) using fewer numbers
