# From Deployment to Feedback

## Deployment

Once the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the ultimate test

Depending on the purpose of the model, it may be rolled out to a **limited group of users** or in a **test environment** to build up confidence in applying the outcome

## Feedback

Once in play, feedback from users will help to refine the model and assess it for performance and impact

The value of the model will be dependent on successfully incorporating feedback and making adjustments for as long as the solution is required

Making the methodology cyclical, ensures refinement at each stage in the game

The feedback process is rooted in the notion that, the more you know, the more that you'll want to know

## Storytelling

It's supercritical to get really good at storytelling with data. The humans naturally understand the world through stories

If you're trying to convince anyone to do anything with data, the first thing you have to do is tell a clear, a concise, compelling story

It's helpful for the data analyst to create a story anytime they are working with a dataset to help themselves better understand the underlying dataset and what it's doing

Always make sure to convey all the complexities that you might find within the data
