# Final Project

## What is CRISP-DM?
CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts. CRISP-DM is an iterative data mining model and a comprehensive methodology for data mining projects which provides a structured approach to guide data-driven decision-making.

## The Six Stages of CRISP-DM

1. **Business Understanding**:
   - The most important stage.
   - Sets and outlines the intentions of the data analysis project.
   - Requires communication and clarity to overcome stakeholders' differing objectives, biases, and information modalities.
   - Ensures a clear and complete understanding of the business problem and project goals.

2. **Data Understanding**:
   - Combines data requirements, data collection, and data understanding.
   - Involves deciding on data sources and acquiring data.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Transforms collected data into a usable subset.
   - Addresses questionable, missing, or ambiguous data values.
   - Determines if more data is needed.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Creates data models that reveal patterns and structures within the data.
   - Selects models based on subsets of the data and adjusts as needed.
   - Focuses on creating knowledge and insights that address the business problem and goals.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Tests the selected model using a pre-selected test.
   - Assesses the model's effectiveness and determines its efficacy.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Uses the model on new data outside the initial dataset.
   - May reveal new variables and the need for a different dataset and model.
   - Iterative and cyclical; deployment results might lead to revisions of business needs, models, or data.

## What Happens After the Final Stage?
After completing all six stages, you'll have another business understanding meeting with stakeholders to discuss the results. In CRISP-DM, this stage is not explicitly named, but in John Rollins' Data Science methodology, it's called the Feedback stage. The CRISP-DM process continues until the stakeholders, management, and you agree that the data model and its analysis provide the answers needed to resolve business problems and attain goals.
