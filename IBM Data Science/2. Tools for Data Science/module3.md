# Libraries, APIs, Datasets and Models

## Libraries for Data Science

### Scientifics Computing Libraries

* Pandas (data structures and tools for data cleaning, manipulation and analysis)

* NumPy: based on array and matrices, allowing you to apply mathematical functions to the arrays

### Visualization Libraries

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

### Machine Learning Libraries

* Scikit-learn

* Keras

### Deep Learning Libraries

* TensorFlow: used for production and deployment

* PyTorch: experimentation


## APIs

An application programming interface allows communication between two pieces of software

### REST APIs

REST APIs is another type of API

* It allows you to communicate through the Internet

* It enables you to use resources like storage, data and artificially intelligent algorithms

* It's used to interact with web services

* It has a set of rules regarding:
    * communication
    * input or request
    * output or response

Your program is the **client**

The Web service is the **resource**

The client find the web service via an **endpoint**

The client sends **requests** to the resource and receives a **response** from the resource

## Data Sets

Data set is a structured collection of data

### Data Structures

* Tabular Data

* Hierarchical / Network Data: used to represent relationships between data (trees or graphs)

* Raw files: images, audios and videos

### Data Licenses

* **CDLA-Sharing**: Permission to use and modify data. Publication only under same terms

* **CDLA-Permissive**: Permission to use and modify data. No obligations


## Machine Learning Models

* Machine Learning models identifies patterns in data

* Model training is the process by which the model learns the data patterns

* After a model is trained, it can be used to make predictions

* Types of ML are: **Supervised**, **Unsupervised** and **Reinforcement**

### Supervised Learning

It's the most commonly used type of Machine Learning

A human provides input data and correct inputs. Then, the model identifies relationships and dependencies between the input data and the correct output

This type of learning comprises two types of models:

* **Regression**: used to predict real numerical values

* **Classification**: used to classify data into categories


### Unsupervised Learning

Now, the data is not labeled (there is only the input, but not the correct answer)

Hence, the model tries to identify patterns ans structures without external help

This type of learning comprises the following types of models:

* **Clustering**

* **Anomaly Detection**


### Reinforcement Learning

Conceptually similar to human learning processes

A reinforcement learning model learns the best set of actions to take, given its current environment, to get the most rewards over time

## Deep Learning

Tries to loosely emulate how the human brain works

Some applications are:

* Natural Language Processing

* Image, audio and video analysis

* Time series forecasting

It requires large datasets of labeled data and is compute intensive

It requires special purpose hardware

You can build a custom Deep Learning model from scratch or use pre-trained models from public model repositories

## Model Asset eXchange

It's a free open source resource for Deep Learning Models

To reduce time, you can take advantage of pre-trained models for certain types of problems

These pre-trained models can be ready to use right away or they might take less time to train
