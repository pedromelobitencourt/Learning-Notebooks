# Data Science Tools

**Categories of Data Science Tools**

Before it can be useful, raw data must pass through Data Science categories, such as:

* Data Management

* Data Integration and Transformation

* Data Visualization

* Model Building

* Model Deployment

* Model Monitoring and Assessment

To do these things, you need **Data Assets Management**, **Code Asset Management**, **Development Environments** and **Execution Environments**

## Data Assets Management

### Data Management

It's the process of collecting, persisting and retrieving data securely, efficiently and cost-effectively

Data is collected from many sources


### Data Integration and Transformation

It's the process of extracting, transforming and loading data (ETL)

Some of the data is distributed in multiple repositories, so you use the extraction process to extract data from numerous sources and save it to a central repository (like a Data Warehouse)

It's also termed **Data Refinery and Cleasing**

Data Warehouses are primarily used to collect and store massive amounts of data

**Data Transformation** is the process of transforming the values, structure and format of data

Once the data is transformed, it's time to load the data. Transformed data is loaded back to the Data Warehouse


### Data Visualization

It's the graphical representation of data and information

You can use plots, charts, maps and animations for instance

Data Visualization conveys data more effectively


### Model Building

* It's a step where you train the data and analyze patterns using suitable machine learning algorithms

### Model Deployment

Integrating a model into a production environment

A machine learning model is made available to third-party applications via APIs


### Model Monitoring and Assessment

It runs continuous quality checks to ensure a model's accuracy, fairness and robustness

**Model Monitoring**: it tracks the deployed models

**Model Assessment**: it checks for accuracy, fairness and robustness, using metrics like: F1 score, True positive rate and Sum of squared error


## Code Asset Management

It's a unified view where you manage an inventory of assets

* Github

## Open Source Tools

### Data Management

* PostgreSQL
