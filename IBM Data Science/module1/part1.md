# Defining Data Science

**Data Science** is a process of using data to understand different things. It's used when you have a model or hypothesis and you try to validate it with your data. It's also the process of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data, so you make strategic choices for a company

It has a significant Data Analysis component. Now we have tons of data available from varied sources and computer power to make useful analysis and generate new knowledge

Data Science can help companies:

* understand their environments

* analyze existing issues

* reveal hidden opportunities

Many companies will use data science to focus on a specific problem, so it's really necessary to **clarify the question that the organization wants answered**

Data scientists must ask questions to **clarify the business need**

Other questions that must be answered is: **what data do we need to solve the problem?**, **where will that data come from?**

Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers. Sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometime it'll be brand new knowledge

When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to the project stakeholders. They can also use powerful visialization tools to help stakeholders understand the nature of the results and the recommended action to take
