# Big Data and Data Mining

The availability of vast amounts of data and the competitive advantage that analyzing it brings has triggered digital transformations throughout many industries

Digital transformation is not simply duplicating existing processes in digital form. The in-depth analysis of how the business operates helps organizations to discover how to improve their processes and operations and harness the benefits of integrating data science into their workflows

## Cloud Computing

* It's the delivery of on-demand computing resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, services, data centers) over the internet on a pay-for-use basis

* Applications and data that users can access over the Internet rather than locally

* Then, there is no need to purchase applications and install them on local computer

* Enables users to work collaboratively

### Cloud Computing Characterists

* **On-demand self-service**: you can access cloud resources using a simple interface without a requiring human interaction

* **Broad Network Access**: cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network

* **Resource Pooling**: it's what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which makes the cloud cost-efficient
    * Using a multitenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers and cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand, without the consumers needing to know the physical location of these resources

* **Rapid Elasticity**: it implies that you can access more resources when you need them and scale back when you don't

* **Measured Service**: you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go. Resource usage is monitored, measured and reported transparently based on consumer utilization


### Cloud Deployment Models

It indicates where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it and how cloud resources and services are made available to users

* **Public**: It's when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies

* **Private**: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization

* **Hybrid**: Mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly


### Cloud Service Models

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: you can access the infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage and data center space without the need to manage and operate them

* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: you can access the platform that comprises the hardware and software tools that are usually needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the Internet

* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: it's a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis

Using cloud enables you to get instant access to open-source technologies without the need to install and configurey them locally

Using the cloud also gives you access to the most up-to-date tools and libraries without the worrying of maintaining them and ensuring that they are up-to-date


## Foundations of Big Data

Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools and machines

It requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered

### The V's of Big Data

* **Velocity**: It's the speed at which data accumulates. Data is being generated extremely fast

* **Volume**: It's the scale of the data or the increase in the amount of data stored
    * Drivers of volume are: the increase in data sources, higher resolution sensors and scalable infrastructure

* **Variety**: It's the diversity of the data. Different types of data, the data comes from different sources, machines, people and processes
    * Drivers are: mobile technologies, social media, wearable technologies, geo technologies, video...

* **Veracity**: It's the quality and the origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy
    * Attributes are: consistency, completeness, integrity and ambiguity
    * Drivers are: cost and need for traceability

* **Value**: It's our ability and need to turn data into value
