# Mastering Spreadsheet Basics

In this spreadsheet, the word "row" is in cell D3.

If a cell has some data that doesn't fit in the cell, you can make the column large or, in a smarter way, you can select the cell, go to "Format" option, then go to "Wrapping", then mark "Wrap"


* Attribute: It's a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column. It can be called as: column name, column labels, header or header row

* Observation: All of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table

To sort by some column, in increasing or decreasing order, you can go to the option selected on the above image and select the column that you want to be the ording parameter

To create a formula, you can click on a empty cell and type "=", then put the instructions that you want


# SQL

You can do the following things with data on a larger scale:

* Store
* Organize
* Analyse

Query is a request for data or information from a database

* To select all data from a database you can do the following: "SELECT * FROM ..."

* Comments are text placed between certain characters, /* and */, or after two dashes (--) as shown below. 

![basic-structure4-sql-query](/Data%20Analytics/assets/sql-query-basic4.png)

* Assign a new name or alias to the column or to table names to make them easier to work with: field1 AS alias_field1

* Difference comparison: thing1 <> thing2 (thing1 is different of thing2)


# Data Visualization

It's the graphical representation of information

It makes the data easier to digest for the audience

Tables filled with data aren't able to show trends and patterns quickly and clearly like data visualization can

Data visualization is interesting to look

Make the stakeholder's time worthwhile

Data visualizations are pictures, they are a wonderful way to take very basic ideas around data and data points and make them come alive


## Steps to plan a data visualization

Imagine you’re a data analyst for a clothing distributor. The company helps small clothing stores manage their inventory, and sales are booming. One day, you learn that your company is getting ready to make a major update to its website. To guide decisions for the website update, you’re asked to analyze data from the existing website and sales records. Let’s go through the steps you might follow. 

### Step 1: explore the data for patterns

First, you ask your manager or the data owner for access to the current sales records and website analytics reports. This includes information about how customers behave on the company’s existing website, basic information about who visited, who bought from the company, and how much they bought.

While reviewing the data you notice a pattern among those who visit the company’s website most frequently: geography and larger amounts spent on purchases. With further analysis, this information might explain why sales are so strong right now in the northeast—and help your company find ways to make them even stronger through the new website. 


### Step 2: plan your visuals

Next it is time to refine the data and present the results of your analysis. Right now, you have a lot of data spread across several different tables, which isn’t an ideal way to share your results with management and the marketing team. You will want to create a data visualization that explains your findings quickly and effectively to your target audience. Since you know your audience is sales oriented, you already know that the data visualization you use should:

* Show sales numbers over time
* Connect sales to location
* Show the relationship between sales and website use
* Show which customers fuel growth


### Step 3: create your visuals

Now that you have decided what kind of information and insights you want to display, it is time to start creating the actual visualizations. Keep in mind that creating the right visualization for a presentation or to share with stakeholders is a process. It involves trying different visualization formats and making adjustments until you get what you are looking for. In this case, a mix of different visuals will best communicate your findings and turn your analysis into the most compelling story for stakeholders. So, you can use the built-in chart capabilities in your spreadsheets to organize the data and create your visuals.


## Build your data visualization toolkit

* You can use the visualizations tools in your spreadsheet to create simple visualizations such as line and bar charts.
* You can use more advanced tools such as Tableau that allow you to integrate data into dashboard-style visualizations. 
* If you’re working with the programming language R you can use the visualization tools in RStudio.
