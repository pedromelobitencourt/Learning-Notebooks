# Follow the Data Life Cycle

The data life is the following:

* Plan: before starting an analysis project. What data will be used? How will it be used? Who will be resposible for it? What are the possible outcomes?
* Capture: data is collected
* Manage: how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools to maintain it secure
* Analyze
* Archive: storing data in a place that it's still available, but may be never be used again
* Destroy: protecting the company's and the users information


# Outlining the Data Analysis Process

Data analysis is the process of analysing data

![The data analysis steps](/Data%20Analytics/assets/data-analysis-steps.png)

Regardless of the kind of data you work on, generally, the process will be the same.

### Ask step

* What problem are we trying to solve?
* What is the purpose of this analysis?
* What are we hoping to learn from it?

### Prepare step

* What type of data we need? (quantitative or qualitative data, cross-sectional or points in time)

* How are we going to collect that data?

* Does the needed data exist already?

### Process step

Understand the data structure, quirks, nuances

Clean the data, in such a way that we can analyze it responsibly

Establish some Quality Assurance Checks

* Are we missing some data?
* Are any outliers that we have to treat differently?


### Analyze step

Analyze in the most unbiased and objective way possible

Run some analysis that we've already thought about based on the questions of "ask step"


# The Data Analysis Toolbox

Some data analysis tools are:

* Spreadsheets
* Query Languages for Databases
* Visualization Tools

## Spreadsheets

Spreadsheet structure data in a meaninful way by letting you:

* Collect, store, organize and sort data
* Iddentify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
* Create excellent data visualizations

### Formula

Formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in the spreadsheet

* Add
* Subtract
* Average of a number set
* Multiply
* Divide


### Function

A preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in the spreadsheet.

We can say that is a more efficient way of doing something that would take a lot of time


## Query Languages

A computer language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database

* Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database
* Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
* Allow analysts to select, create, add or download data from a database for analysis

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

It's a language that allows data analysts communicate with the database

* Easy to understand
* Works very well with all kinds of databases
* Query is a more like a request


## Data Visualization

It's the graphical representantion of information.

It helps the analysts communicate their insights to others in an effective and compelling way

* Graphs
* Maps
* Tables

Some data visualization tools are:

* Tableau: create visuals that are very easy to understand
* Looker: easy to create visuals based on the results
