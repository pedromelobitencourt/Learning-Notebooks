# Follow the Data Life Cycle

The data life is the following:

* Plan: before starting an analysis project. What data will be used? How will it be used? Who will be resposible for it? What are the possible outcomes?
* Capture: data is collected
* Manage: how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools to maintain it secure
* Analyze
* Archive: storing data in a place that it's still available, but may be never be used again
* Destroy: protecting the company's and the users information


# Outlining the Data Analysis Process

Data analysis is the process of analysing data

Regardless of the kind of data you work on, generally, the process will be the same.

### Ask step

* What problem are we trying to solve?
* What is the purpose of this analysis?
* What are we hoping to learn from it?

### Prepare step

* What type of data we need? (quantitative or qualitative data, cross-sectional or points in time)

* How are we going to collect that data?

* Does the needed data exist already?

### Process step

Understand the data structure, quirks, nuances

Clean the data, in such a way that we can analyze it responsibly

Establish some Quality Assurance Checks

* Are we missing some data?
* Are any outliers that we have to treat differently?


### Analyze step

Analyze in the most unbiased and objective way possible

Run some analysis that we've already thought about based on the questions of "ask step"
