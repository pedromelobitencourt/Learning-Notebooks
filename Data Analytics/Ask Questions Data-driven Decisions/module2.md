# Understanding the power of data

* Data-inspired decision-making: explore different data sources to find out what they have in common

* Algorithm: a process or a set of rules to be followed for a specific task

Every single action that we do in this world is triggering off some amount of data, and most of that data is meaningless until someone adds some interpretation of it or someone adds a narrative around it

Both **data-driven** and **data-inspired** approaches are rooted in the idea that data is inherently valuable for making a decision. Well-curated data can provide information to  decision-makers that improves the quality of their decisions. 

Data does not make decisions, but it does improve them.

## Data-driven decisions

he phrase “data-driven decisions” means exactly that: Data is used to arrive at a decision. This approach is limited by the quantity and quality of readily-available data. If the quality and quantity of the data is sufficient, this approach can far improve decision-making.

But if the data is insufficient or biased, this can create problems for decision-makers. Potential dangers of relying entirely on data-driven decision-making can include overreliance on historical data, a tendency to ignore qualitative insights, and potential biases in data collection and analysis

### Example

A/B testing is a simple example of collecting data for data-driven decision-making. For example, a website that sells widgets has an idea for a new website layout they think will result in more people buying widgets. For two weeks, half of their website visitors are directed to the old site; the other half are directed to the new site. After those two weeks, the analyst gathers the data about their website visitors and the number of widgets sold for analysis. This helps the analyst understand which website layout resulted in more widget sales. If the new website performed better in producing widget sales, then the company can confidently make the decision to use the new layout!


## Data-inspired decisions

Data-inspired decisions include the same considerations as data-driven decisions while adding another layer of complexity. They create space for people using data to consider a broader range of ideas: drawing on comparisons to related concepts, giving weight to feelings and experiences, and considering other qualities that may be more difficult to measure. Data-inspired decision-making can avoid some of the pitfalls that data-driven decisions might be prone to. 


### Example

A customer support center gathers customer satisfaction data (often known as a “CSAT” score). They use a simple 1–10 score along with a qualitative description in which the customer describes their experience. The customer support center manager wants to improve customer experience, so they set a goal to improve the CSAT score. They start by analyzing the CSAT scores and reading each of the descriptions from the customers. Additionally, they interview the people working in the customer support center. From there, the manager formulates a strategy and decides what needs to improve the most in order to raise customer satisfaction scores. While the manager certainly relies on the CSAT data in the decision-making process, input of support center representatives and other qualitative information informs the approach as well.


**Quantitative data**: specific and objective measures of numerical facts, in other words, things you can measure

* The what?
* How many?
* How often?

Numbers can be visualized as charts or graphs


**Qualitative data**: subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics, things that can't be measured by numerical data

* Why?

It gives a more high-level understanding, add context

You can use, in a problem, quantitative and qualitative data. For instance: customer's review

### Quantitative

* How many negative reviews are there?
* What's the average rating?
* How many of these reviews use the same keywords?


### Qualitative

* Why are customers insatisfied?
* How can we improve their experience?
