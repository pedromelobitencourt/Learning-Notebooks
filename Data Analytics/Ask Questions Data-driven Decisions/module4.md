# Balance team and stakeholder needs

Your data analysis project should answer the business task and create opportunities for data-driven decision-making. That's why it is so important to focus on project stakeholders. As a data analyst, it is your responsibility to understand and manage your stakeholders’ expectations while keeping the project goals front and center.

You might remember that stakeholders are people who have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you are  working on. This can be a pretty broad group, and your project stakeholders may change from project to project. But there are three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself working with: the executive team, the customer-facing team, and the data science team.

Let’s get to know more about the different stakeholders and their goals. Then we'll learn some tips for communicating with them effectively.

## Executive Team

The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively. The executive team might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work. These stakeholders think about decisions at a very high level and they are looking for the headline news about your project first.  They are less interested in the details. Time is very limited with them, so make the most of it by leading your presentations with the answers to their questions. You can keep the more detailed information handy in your presentation appendix or your project documentation for them to dig into when they have more time. 

For example, you might find yourself working with the vice president of human resources on an analysis project to understand the rate of employee absences. A marketing director might look to you for competitive analyses. Part of your job will be balancing what information they will need to make informed decisions with their busy schedule. 

But you don’t have to tackle that by yourself. Your project manager will be overseeing the progress of the entire team, and you will be giving them more regular updates than someone like the vice president of HR. They are able to give you what you need to move forward on a project, including getting approvals from the busy executive team. Working closely with your project manager can help you pinpoint the needs of the executive stakeholders for your project, so don’t be afraid to ask them for guidance. 


## Customer-facing Team

The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization. These stakeholders have their own objectives and may come to you with specific asks. It is important to let the data tell the story and not be swayed by asks from your stakeholders to find certain patterns that might not exist. 

Let’s say a customer-facing team is working with you to build a new version of a company’s most popular product. Part of your work might involve collecting and sharing data about consumers’ buying behavior to help inform product features. Here, you want to be sure that your analysis and presentation focuses on what is actually in the data-- not on what your stakeholders hope to find. 


## Data science team

Organizing data within a company takes teamwork. There's a good chance you'll find yourself working with other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. For example, maybe you team up with a company's data science team to work on boosting company engagement to lower rates of employee turnover. In that case, you might look into the data on employee productivity, while another analyst looks at hiring data. Then you share those findings with the data scientist on your team, who uses them to predict how new processes could boost employee productivity and engagement. When you share what you found in your individual analyses, you uncover the bigger story. A big part of your job will be collaborating with other data team members to find new angles of the data to explore. Here's a view of how  different roles on a typical data science team support different functions:

You may be working in a lot of projects and with a lot of people, but no matter what project you are working on, there are three things you can focus on that will help you on the task

1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders? What are their goals?

2. Who is managing the data? -> You can spend your time more productively by communicating your objectives with another data analyst

3. Where can you go to help? Project managers?


# Clear communication is key

Think who you want to communicate with and when

Before you communicate, think about:

* Who your audience is?

* What they already know?

* What they need to know?

* How you can communicate that effectively to them?

Never be afraid to ask

Eye contact and firm handshake

Bow

Set **realistic** and objective goals: don't put to much expectation if you are not sure (don't overpromise)

Set a reasonable and realistic timeline

As a data analyst, there's going to be times where you have different stakeholders who have no idea about the amount of time that it takes you to do each project, and in the very beginning when I'm asked to do a project or to look into something, I always try to give a little bit of expectation settings on the turn around because most of your stakeholders don't really understand what you do with data and how you get it and how you clean it and put together the story behind it. The other thing that I want to make clear to everyone is that you have to make sure that the data tells you the stories. Sometimes people think that data can answer everything and sometimes we have to acknowledge that that is simply untrue

* Speed can be enemy of accuracy


## Limitations of the data

Data is powerful, but it has its limitations. Has someone’s personal opinion found its way into the numbers? Is your data telling the whole story? Part of being a great data analyst is knowing the limits of data and planning for them. This reading explores how you can do that.

### The case of incomplete data

If you have incomplete or nonexistent data, you might realize during an analysis that you don't have enough data to reach a conclusion. Or, you might even be solving a different problem altogether! For example, suppose you are looking for employees who earned a particular certificate but discover that certification records go back only two years at your company. You can still use the data, but you will need to make the limits of your analysis clear. You might be able to find an alternate source of the data by contacting the company that led the training. But to be safe, you should be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available.

### Don't miss misaligned data

If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another. For example, if a metric is the total number of trainees in a certificate program, you could have one team that counts every person who registered for the training, and another team that counts only the people who completed the program. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between teams are meaningful and insightful.

### Deal with dirty data

Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When you find and fix the errors - while tracking the changes you made - you can avoid a data disaster. You will learn how to clean data later in the training.

### Tell a clear story

Avinash Kaushik, a Digital Marketing Evangelist for Google, has lots of great tips for data analysts in his 
blog: Occam's Razor
. Below are some of the best practices he recommends for good data storytelling: 

Compare the same types of data: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics. 

Visualize with care: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.

Leave out needless graphs: If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.

Test for statistical significance: Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.

Pay attention to sample size: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.
