# Problem Solving and Effective Questioning

In "Ask" step, we define the problem that we are solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholders expectations

* Structured Thinking: the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing the available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options

We use "Divide to Conquer" strategy: we address a vague and complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps


# Take Action with Data

### Ask

When you want to advertise in order to expand your business, you have to think who are your target audience. Futhermore, you must think about your budget and how much each advertising strategy will cost

To solve this problem, you begin by asking in such a way to define the problem to be solved. To do this, you must zoom out to look at the whole situation. You have to focus on the entire problem, not just the symptoms


### Prepare

Collect data for the upcoming analysis process, but you need to understand the company's target audience. Then, you should collect data on the different advertising methods. In this way, you can know which is the most popular one with the company's audience


### Process

Clean the data to remove any errors or inaccuracies

* Cleaning data: transform data into a more useful format, create more complete information and remove outliers


## From issue to action: the six data analysis phases

### Ask

There are some things to consider in this phase:

* Defining the problem you are trying to solve
* Make sure you fully understand your stakeholder's expectations
* Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
* Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
* Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask:

* What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
* Now that i've identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?


### Prepare

You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful

You have to decide the following:

* What metrics to measure?
* Locate the data in your database
* Create security measures to protect that data

Questions to ask:

* What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
* What research do I need to do?


### Process 

Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

* Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
* Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
* Removing repeated entries
* Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

Questions to ask:

* What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
* How can I clean the my data so the information I have is more consistent?


### Analyze

You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 

* Perform calculations
* Combine data from multiple sources
* Create tables with your results

Questions to ask?

* What story is my data telling me?
* How will my data help me solve this problem?
* Who needs my company's product or service? What type of person is more likely to use it?


### Share

Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team: 

* Make better decisions
* Make more informed decisions
* Lead to stronger outcomes
* Successfully communicate your findings

Questions to ask:

* How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
* What would help me understand this if I were the listener?


### Act

Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

Questions to ask:

* How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

# Solve problems with data

Think of problems as opportunities to put your skills to work and find creative and insightful solutions

## Types of problems

* Making predictions: using data to make informed decisions about how things may be in the future
    * a hospital system might use a remote patient monitoring to predict health events for chronically ill patients. The patients would take their health vitals at home every day, and that information combined with data about their age, risk factors, and other important details could enable the hospital's algorithm to predict future health problems and even reduce future hospitalizations

    * A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

* Categorizing things: assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
    * An example of this problem type is a manufacturer that reviews data on shop floor employee performance. An analyst may create a group for employees who are most and least effective at engineering. A group for employees who are most and least effective at repair and maintenance, most and least effective at assembly, and many more groups or clusters

    * An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

* Spotting something new: identify data that is different from the norm
    * An instance of spotting something unusual in the real world is a school system that has a sudden increase in the number of students registered, maybe as big as a 30 percent jump in the number of students. A data analyst might look into this upswing and discover that several new apartment complexes had been built in the school district earlier that year. They could use this analysis to make sure the school has enough resources to handle the additional students
    
    * A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

* Identifying themes: group categorized information into broader concepts
    * Going back to our manufacturer that has just reviewed data on the shop floor employees. First, these people are grouped by types and tasks. But now a data analyst could take those categories and group them into the broader concept of low productivity and high productivity. This would make it possible for the business to see who is most and least productive, in order to reward top performers and provide additional support to those workers who need more training

    * User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 
    By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

* Discovering connections: finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
    * Here's what I mean; say a scooter company is experiencing an issue with the wheels it gets from its wheel supplier. That company would have to stop production until it could get safe, quality wheels back in stock. But meanwhile, the wheel companies encountering the problem with the rubber it uses to make wheels, turns out its rubber supplier could not find the right materials either. If all of these entities could talk about the problems they're facing and share data openly, they would find a lot of similar challenges and better yet, be able to collaborate to find a solution

    * A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 

* Finding patterns: using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again
    * commerce companies use data to find patterns all the time. Data analysts look at transaction data to understand customer buying habits at certain points in time throughout the year. They may find that customers buy more canned goods right before a hurricane, or they purchase fewer cold-weather accessories like hats and gloves during warmer months. The ecommerce companies can use these insights to make sure they stock the right amount of products at these key times

    * Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.

## Problem: improve customer satisfaction levels (categorizing)

Data analysts could review recorded calls to the company's customer service department and evaluate the satisfaction levels of each caller. They could identify certain key words or phrases that come up during the phone calls and then assign them to categories such as politeness, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, empathy, and more. Categorizing these key words gives us data that lets the company identify top performing customer service representatives, and those who might need more coaching. This leads to happier customers and higher customer service scores

## Problem: make people stay healthy (spotting something unusual)

These apps can help people stay healthy by collecting data such as their heart rate, sleep patterns, exercise routine, and much more. There are many stories out there about health apps actually saving people's lives. One is about a woman who was young, athletic, and had no previous medical problems. One night she heard a beep on her smartwatch, a notification said her heart rate had spiked. Now in this example think of the watch as a data analyst. The watch was collecting and analyzing health data. So when her resting heart rate was suddenly 120 beats per minute, the watch spotted something unusual because according to its data, the rate was normally around 70. Thanks to the data her smart watch gave her, the woman went to the hospital and discovered she had a condition which could have led to life threatening complications if she hadn't gotten medical help

## Problem: improve user experience (identifying themes)

User experience designers study and work to improve the interactions people have with products they use every day. Let's say a user experience designer wants to see what customers think about the coffee maker his company manufactures. This business collects anonymous survey data from users, which can be used to answer this question. But first to make sense of it all, he will need to find themes that represent the most valuable data, especially information he can use to make the user experience even better. So the problem the user experience designer's company faces, is how to improve the user experience for its coffee makers. The process here is kind of like finding categories for keywords and phrases in customer service conversations. But identifying themes goes even further by grouping each insight into a broader theme. Then the designer can pinpoint the themes that are most common. In this case he learned users often couldn't tell if the coffee maker was on or off. He ended up optimizing the design with improved placement and lighting for the on/off button, leading to the product improvement and happier users

## Problem: reduce wait time (discovering connections)

Wait time happens when a truck driver from the third party logistics provider arrives to pick up a shipment but it's not ready. So she has to wait. That costs both companies time and money and it stops trucks from getting back on the road to make more deliveries. So how can they solve this? Well, by sharing data the partner companies can view each other's timelines and see what's causing shipments to run late. Then they can figure out how to avoid those problems in the future. So a problem for one business doesn't cause a negative impact for the other. For example, if shipments are running late because one company only delivers Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and the other company only delivers Tuesdays and Thursdays, then the companies can choose to deliver on the same day to reduce wait time for customers

## Problem: stop the machines from breaking down (finding patterns)

One way data analysts can do this is by looking at patterns in the company's historical data. For example, they could investigate how and when a particular machine broke down in the past and then generate insights into what led to the breakage. In this case, the company saw pattern indicating that machines began breaking down at faster rates when maintenance wasn't kept up in 15 day cycles. They can then keep track of current conditions and intervene if any of these issues happen again

## From hypothesis to outcome

At its core, my job is about connecting the right user with the right message at the right time. The first step is really to get a broad sense of the certain pattern that's occurring. 

So for example, we know that this particular segment of users is more responsive to this type of content. Once we're able to actually see this hypothesis through the data, we do **testing** to ensure that the hypothesis is actually correct. So for example, we would test sending these pieces of content to this segment of users, and actually verify within a **controlled environment** whether that response rate is actually higher for that type of content, or whether it isn't. 

Once we're able to actually verify that hypothesis, we go back to the stakeholders, in this case, our marketers, and say, we've proven within a relatively high degree of certainty that this particular segment is more responsive to this type of content, and because of that, we're recommending that you produce more of this type of content. 

Our stakeholders really get to see the whole evolution from hypothesis to proven concept, and they're able to come with us on the journey on how we're proving out these hypotheses and then eventually turning them into strategies and recommendations for the business. The outcome in this case was that we were able to actually change the way our whole marketing team worked to actually make it much more user-centric


# Craft Effective Questions

* Leading Question: question that leads you to answer in a certain way

* Closed-ended Question: question that can be answered by a simply "Yes" or "No". It rarely leads to valuable insights

* Question that is to vague and lacks context: "Do you prefer vannila or chocolate?"


The effective questions follow the SMART methodology:

* S: specific
* M: measurable
* A: action-oriented
* R: relevant
* T: time-bound

Effective questions should be simple, significant and focused on a single topic or few closed ideas

If a question is too general, try to narrow it down by focusing on only one element:

    For example, instead of asking a closed-ended question, like, "are kids getting enough physical activities these days?"
    
    Ask what percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week?

* Measurable questions can be qualified and assessed
    * Unmeasurable example: Why did our recent video go viral?
    * Mesuarable example: How many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted?


* Action-oriented question: encourages change

* Relevant question: It matters, is important, and has significance to the problem you are trying to solve

    Let's say you're working on a problem related to a threatened species of frog. And you asked, why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing? This is an irrelevant question because the answer won't help us find a way to prevent these frogs from going extinct. A more relevant question would be, what environmental factors changed in Durham, North Carolina between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from the Sandhills Regions? This question would give us answers we can use to help solve our problem

* Time-bound question: specify the time to be studied

    The time period we want to study is 1983 to 2004. This limits the range of possibilities and enables the data analyst to focus on relevant data

![SMART-questions](/Data%20Analytics/Ask%20Questions%20Data-driven%20Decisions/assets/SMART-questions.png)


## Examples of SMART questions

Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: What features do people look for when buying a new car?

* Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

* Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?

* Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

* Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

* Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 


Questions should be open-ended. This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem. So, based on the thought process, possible SMART questions might be:

* On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?

* What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?

* What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?

* How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?

* Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?


## Things to avoid when asking questions

**Leading questions:** questions that only have a particular response

* Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?
    * This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, “What is your opinion of this product?” There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

**Closed-ended questions:** questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

* Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?
    * This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, “What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.” This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

**Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

* Example: Does the tool work for you?
    * This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. A better inquiry might be, “When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).

* Data Engineer: a data analyst will work with a data engineer to turn that raw data into actionable pipelines
