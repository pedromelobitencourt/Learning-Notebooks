# Unbiased and Objective Data

## Bias: from questions to answers

Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and make quick judgements

* **Bias**: a preference in favor or or against a person, group of people or thing

* **Data Bias**: a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction

Maybe the questions on a survey had a particular slant to influence answers or the sample group wasn't representative of the group being studied

Bias can also happens if a sample lacks inclusivity

If you give little time to answer the questions, the answers will be rushed and when we're rushed, we tend to make more mistakes

**Conclusions can have serious implications**, so we have to take care

## Biased and unbiased data

* **Sampling bias**: when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole

You can avoid sampling bias by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. For example, you make a survey that only included women, but there was other genders in the population

* **Unbiased Sampling**: when a sample is representative of the population being measured


## Understand bias in data

* **Observer bias** (experimenter/research bias): the tendency for different people to observe things differently

* **Interpretation bias**: the tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way

* **Confirmation bias**: the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs

Those types of bias impact the way we collect and interpret the data

## Achieve data credibility

There are good practices to follow that will help us measure the reliability of datasets

The more good quality data we have, the more confidence we can have in our decisions

**How to identify good data sources?**

* R: reliable
* O: original (validate the data from second or third party with the original source)
* C: comprehensive (all critical information needed to answer the question)
* C: current
* C: cited (makes the information more reliable)

The best bet is to go with the vetted pulblic data sets, academic papers, financial data and governmental agency data


## Bad data

* Not reliable: Bad data can't be trusted because it's inaccurate, incomplete or biased

This could be data that has sample selection bias, because it doesn't **reflect** the overall population or it could be data visualizations or graphs that are just **misleading**

* Not original: you can't locate the original data source

* Not comprehensive: data that are missing important information needed to answer the question or they can have human error

* Not current: outdate and irrelevant

* Not cited

Bad data can led to serious and lasting impacts, whether it's incorrect conclusion leading to one bad business decision or inaccurate information

# Data Ethics and Privacy

* **Ethics**: well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness or specific values

* **Data Ethics**: well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictates how the data is collected, shared and used

Since the ability to collect, share and use data in large quantities is relatively new, the rules that regulare and govern the process are still **evolving**

The importance of data privacy has been recognized by governments worldwide and they started to create data protection legislation

## Aspects of data ethics

* **Ownership**: individuals own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over its usage, how it's processed and how it's shared

* **Transaction transparency**: all data-processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides the data

* **Consent**: an individual's right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it

* **Currency**: individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions. You have the option to opt out your data

**Keep in mind that all data come from people, so, at the end of the day, data are people**

You should have responsibility to those people represented in the data. So, we should keep their data private

We need to empower people to control their own data

## Prioritize data privacy

* **Privacy**: preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs

So, the users should have protection from unauthorized access to their private data, freedom from inappropriate use of their data, the right to inspect, update or correct their data, ability to give consent to use their data and legal right to use their data

* **Openness**: free access, usage and sharing of data

## Data anonymization

**Personally identifiable information** (PII) is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity

**Data anonymization** is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information

Typically, it involves *blanking*, *hashing* or *masking* personal information

As a data analyst, you might be expected to understand what data needs to be anonymized, but you generally wouldn't be responsible for the data anonymization itself

### Types of data that should be anonymized

**De-identification** is a process used to wipe data clean of all personally identifying information

* Telephone numbers

* Names

* License plates and license numbers

* Social security numbers

* IP addresses

* Medical records

* Email addresses

* Photographs

* Account numbers


# Understand open data

We can't ignore other aspects of data ethics (ownership, consent, transaction transparency, privacy, currency)

We can access, use and share the data if it meets these high standards

Open data must be **available** as a whole, preferably by downloading over the Internet in a convenient and modifiable form

Open data must be provided under terms that allow **reuse and redistribution**

Everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute data

* **Data interoperability**: the ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data

### Pros

* Credible databases can be used more widely

* All data can be leveraged, shared and combined with other data (it would promote huge impacts)

### Cons

* Lots of resources to make it feasible

* Lots of colaboration
