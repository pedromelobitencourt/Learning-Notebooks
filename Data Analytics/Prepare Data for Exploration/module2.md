# Unbiased and Objective Data

## Bias: from questions to answers

Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and make quick judgements

* **Bias**: a preference in favor or or against a person, group of people or thing

* **Data Bias**: a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction

Maybe the questions on a survey had a particular slant to influence answers or the sample group wasn't representative of the group being studied

Bias can also happens if a sample lacks inclusivity

If you give little time to answer the questions, the answers will be rushed and when we're rushed, we tend to make more mistakes

**Conclusions can have serious implications**, so we have to take care

## Biased and unbiased data

* **Sampling bias**: when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole

You can avoid sampling bias by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. For example, you make a survey that only included women, but there was other genders in the population

* **Unbiased Sampling**: when a sample is representative of the population being measured


## Understand bias in data

* **Observer bias** (experimenter/research bias): the tendency for different people to observe things differently

* **Interpretation bias**: the tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way

* **Confirmation bias**: the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs

Those types of bias impact the way we collect and interpret the data
