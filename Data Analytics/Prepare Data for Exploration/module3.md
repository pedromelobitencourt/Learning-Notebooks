# Work with Databases

* **Database**: a collection of data stored in a computer system

* **Metadata**: data about data

It's important that whenever is possible to analyze how you analyze data to make sure that the analysis is efficient and there is no biases

Databases store and organize data, making it much easier for data analysts to access and manage data

* **Relational Database**: a database that contains a series of related tables that are connected via their relationships
    * for two or more tables have relationship, one or more of the same fields must exist inside both tables (those keys are called *keys*)

* **Primary Key**: it's an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique (row identifier)
    * It cannot be null
    * Unique

* **Composite Key**: it's a primary key that is construct using more than 1 column

* **Foreign Key**: a field within a table that is a primary key in another table
    * a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between tables
    * it's allowed more than one in a table
