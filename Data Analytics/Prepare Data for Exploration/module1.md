# Data Exploration

Understanding the different types of data and data structures helps to know what type of data is right for the question we're answering

# Collect Data

Tons of data is being generated all around the world

Every piece of information is data and all data is a result of our activity in the world

We can generate data by collecting information. This kind of generation and collection comes with a few more things to think about: it needs to be done with consideration to **ethics**, maintaining people's right and privacy

One example is **survey data**

## How data is collected?

* Interviews

* Observations

* Forms

* Questionnaires

* Surveys

* Cookies (to track people's activity and interests, it's the most effective method)

## Data collection consideration

For instance, let's have a question as example: What's causing increased rush hour traffic in our city?

**How the data will be collected?**

We might use our observations of traffic patterns to count the number of cars on city streets in particular times

**Choose data sources**

* First-party data: data collected by an individual or group using their own resources (preferred source since we know exacty where the data came from)

* Second-party data: data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold (for example, an organization which led traffic pattern studies in our city, it's still a reliable source and with experience with traffic analysis)

* Third-party data: data collected by outside sources who dit not collect it directly (less reliable one, but it can be useful, so you must check bias, accuracy and credibility)

Every data has to be inspected for accuracy and trustworthiness

**What data to use?**

Data that can help solve problems

**How much data to collect?**

* Population: all possible data values in a certain dataset

* Sample: part of a population that is representative of the population

How to choose the sample depends on our project

**Select the right data type**

Dates of traffic records stored in a data format

**Determine the time frame**

Use historical data
