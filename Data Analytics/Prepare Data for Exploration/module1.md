# Data Exploration

Understanding the different types of data and data structures helps to know what type of data is right for the question we're answering

# Collect Data

Tons of data is being generated all around the world

Every piece of information is data and all data is a result of our activity in the world

We can generate data by collecting information. This kind of generation and collection comes with a few more things to think about: it needs to be done with consideration to **ethics**, maintaining people's right and privacy

One example is **survey data**

## How data is collected?

* Interviews

* Observations

* Forms

* Questionnaires

* Surveys

* Cookies (to track people's activity and interests, it's the most effective method)

## Data collection consideration

For instance, let's have a question as example: What's causing increased rush hour traffic in our city?

**How the data will be collected?**

We might use our observations of traffic patterns to count the number of cars on city streets in particular times

**Choose data sources**

* First-party data: data collected by an individual or group using their own resources (preferred source since we know exacty where the data came from)

* Second-party data: data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold (for example, an organization which led traffic pattern studies in our city, it's still a reliable source and with experience with traffic analysis)

* Third-party data: data collected by outside sources who dit not collect it directly (less reliable one, but it can be useful, so you must check bias, accuracy and credibility)

Every data has to be inspected for accuracy and trustworthiness

**What data to use?**

Data that can help solve problems

**How much data to collect?**

* Population: all possible data values in a certain dataset

* Sample: part of a population that is representative of the population

How to choose the sample depends on our project

**Select the right data type**

Dates of traffic records stored in a data format

**Determine the time frame**

Use historical data


# Differentiate Data Formats and Structures

* **Qualitative data**: data that can't be counted, measured or easily expressed using numbers
    * Nominal data: data that is categorized without a set order (it doesn't have a sequence)
    * Ordinal data: data with a set order or scale

* **Quantative data**: data that can be measured or counted and expressed using numbers
    * Discrete data: data that is counted and has a limited number of values, partial measurements (half star) aren't allowed
    * Continuous data: data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value

* **Internal data**: data that lives within a company's own systems (more reliable and easier to collect)

* **External data**: data that lives and is generated outside of an organization

* **Structured data**: data that is stored in a particular format such as rows and columns (spreadsheets, tables)

* **Unstructured data**: data that is not organized in any easily identifiable manner (audio files, video files)

Most of the data being generated right now is unstructured data, such as: audio files, video files, emails, photos, social media. They can be hard to work on, but most of the time we'll be working with structured data since the unstructured data will most likely be structured for analysis

Stuctured data works nicely with a **data model** and makes data visualization easy

* **Data model**: model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another, providing a map of how data is organized

* **Data elements**: pieces of information, such as people's names

The lack of structure makes unstructured data difficult to search, manage, and analyze. But recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are beginning to change that. Now, the **new challenge** facing data scientists is making sure these tools are **inclusive** and **unbiased**
