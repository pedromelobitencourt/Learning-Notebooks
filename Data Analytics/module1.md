# Data Analytics

Every company use data. It doesn't matter which kind of organization is. They need data analystics to improve their processes, identify oportunities and trends and make thoughtful decisions. After analysing and transforming some data, we can turn data into insights, what can be influential into making decisions.

* Data is a collection of facts, such as: words, pictures...
* Data analysis is the collection, the interpretation, the transformation and the organization of data in order to draw conclusions, to make predictions and drive informed decision-making. Moreover, it verify patterns

The analysis helps you to make things easier, identify patterns which can save you time and discover new perspectives

How fast can you dive into an infinite amount of data to explore it and discover its gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to the decision makers?

Subject Matter Experts: people that have the ability to look at the results of the data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas and validate choices being made

In addition, try asking yourself these questions about a project to help find the perfect balance:

* What kind of results are needed?

* Who will be informed?

* Am I answering the question being asked?

* How quickly does a decision need to be made?

## Six Steps of Data Analysis

The six steps of data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. Now, we're going to give an example:

An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees? 

### Ask
First up, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis. These were the kinds of questions they asked:

* What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job? 

* Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?

* Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?

* What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?

* By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?


### Prepare
It all started with solid preparation. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from an online survey of new employees. These were the things they did to prepare:

* They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation. 

* They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside the group wouldn't have access to the raw data, but could view summarized or aggregated data. For example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable. 

* They finalized what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them.


### Process
The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, these were the steps they took:

* They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts. 

* They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses. 

* They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security. 


### Analyze
Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts discovered that an employeeâ€™s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. These were their findings:

* Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company. 

* Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company. 

The group knew it was important to document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future.


### Share
Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful sharing the report. This is how they shared their findings:

* They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey. 

* They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture. 

* They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams. 


### Act
The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings. These were their recommendations: 

* Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices. 

* Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year. 

A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that a comparison between the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked. Turns out, the changes improved the retention rate for new employees and the actions taken by leaders were successful! 

This process gave managers an opportunity to communicate the results with the right context. As a result, they could have productive team conversations about next steps to improve employee engagement. 


## Data Ecosystem
The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze and share data.


## Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

### Advantages
* Easily sharing information
* Interactively explore opportunities
* Visualize patterns and relationships

### Disavantages
* Biased or inaccurate information
* Correlation doesn't always mean causation


## Gap Analysis


Gap analysis is a strategic planning tool used to assess the difference, or "gap," between a company's current performance and its desired, future state. It involves evaluating the present state of affairs, identifying where the organization wants to be, and then determining the steps needed to bridge the gap between the two.

* Determine Current State: Understand and document the current situation, including processes, performance, and resources. This involves gathering data and feedback from relevant stakeholders.

* Define Future State: Clearly articulate the desired state or goals that the organization wants to achieve. This could be based on industry benchmarks, regulatory requirements, or internal objectives.

* Identify the Gap: Analyze the differences between the current state and the future state. This involves comparing key performance indicators, skill sets, resources, technology, or any other relevant factors.

* Prioritize Gaps: Not all identified gaps are of equal importance. Prioritize the gaps based on their impact on organizational goals and objectives.

* Develop an Action Plan: Create a detailed plan outlining the steps necessary to close the identified gaps. This may involve implementing new processes, acquiring additional resources, or developing the skills of the workforce.

* Implement Changes: Put the action plan into effect, making the necessary changes to move from the current state to the desired future state.

* Monitor Progress: Regularly assess and monitor progress towards closing the identified gaps. This may involve ongoing measurement of key performance indicators and adjusting the action plan as needed.


## Process of guiding business strategy using facts

The process of guiding business strategy using facts involves a systematic approach to decision-making that relies on data and evidence rather than intuition or gut feelings. This process, often referred to as data-driven decision-making, ensures that business strategies are well-informed and based on empirical evidence. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:


## Data Analysis Life Cycle
It's the process of going from data to decision. The data goes throught several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed and reused
